##Introduction to Bioinformatics (for the first rotation particularly non biologists):##

**Life sciences in your computer:**    (https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinform)

+LLP- Ideal for those from a non-biology background to get to grips with the first rotation in genetics. 
    
 **Bioinformatic methods I&II:**   (https://class.coursera.org/bioinfomethods1-001)
  
+LLP- Same as above and covers similar topics. Good for general background.

##Introductory level Python courses:##

**codecademy python :**    (https://www.codecademy.com/learn)
  
+LLP- Good intro to the syntax of python. You  get through the course fairly quickly. Composed of small, guided, exercises
    
**Python for everybody:**    (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
  
++LLP- Very clearly explained programming principles. Useful to get to grips with python quickly.
    
**Interactive programming through python:**   (https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython)
  
++LLP- Fun course where you get to make your own games and learn to program at the same time. Quite addictive.
  
##Introduction to Computer Science:##

**Introduction to computer science and programming using python :**
  (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-5)
  
+++LLP- Excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.

**Introduction to computational thinking and data science:** (https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-2x-introduction-computational-2836#.VAhBKsV3Vc0)
  
+++LLP- Excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.
    
**Introduction to computer science CS50 :**    (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
  
+++LLP- Really good, fun, overview of computer science. Excellent explanations of principles. 

##Algorithms:##

**Rosalind:**   (www.rosalind.info)
  
+++LLP- wonderful set of programs to work through slowly. Helpful to do concurrently with any of the learning to program courses as it helps highlight the uses of programming in a biological context.
    
**Bioinformatics Specialisation:**  (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)
  
+++LLP- wonderful course created by the same people as Rosalind. Can be made more or less challenging, online e-book is great. Can't recommend highly enough. 

##Introduction to Genomics:##

**Genomic data science:**    (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomics?utm_medium=courseDescripTop)
  
+LLP- Most courses in the specialisation are very simple, but would give first years a fairly good grounding on the basics
  
##Statistics:##

**Statistics and R for the life sciences:** (https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-r-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x#!)
  
+LLP- An entire specialisation dealing with data analysis (with R).  First iteration was good, but assignments needed a bit more work (they were too guided), I hear new iterations are better. 

##Databases:##

**Introduction to Databases:**  (https://class.coursera.org/db)
  
+LLP- Good explanation of different kinds of databases. A little dry as a course, for my liking, but gets the basic job done.

##Physics roation: ##

**Circuits and Electronics:**   (https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.002_4x/3T2014/info)
  
LLP- I found this course post-Liverpool. But I went through it for completness sake. It's pretty good and could be of use if you are keen, but not required.
