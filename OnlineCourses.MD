## Introduction to Bioinformatics (for the first rotation particularly non biologists): ##

**Life sciences in your computer:**    (https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinform)

+LLP- Ideal for those from a non-biology background to get to grips with the first rotation in genetics. 
    
 **Bioinformatic methods I&II:**   (https://class.coursera.org/bioinfomethods1-001)
  
+LLP- Same as above and covers similar topics. Good for general background.

**Quantitative Biology Workshop:**    (https://www.edx.org/course/quantitative-biology-workshop-mitx-7-qbwx-1)

+++LLP- Great overview of many different computational skills/programming languages used in biology: MATLAB, Python, R, PyMol etc...  

## Introductory level Python courses: ##

**Learn python the hard way :** (http://learnpythonthehardway.org)

+++MW- Fantastic intro to a wide range of Python concepts. Each section introduces a concept along with a context you would use it in, and a range of code examples to practice with. Fast paced and a fun read.

**codecademy python :**    (https://www.codecademy.com/learn)
  
+LLP- Good intro to the syntax of python. You  get through the course fairly quickly. Composed of small, guided, exercises
    
**Python for everybody:**    (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
  
++LLP- Very clearly explained programming principles. Useful to get to grips with python quickly.

**Using Python to Access Web Data:**    (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data)

++LLP- Follows naturally from Python for everybody. Useful for interacting with REST services etc.

**Interactive programming through python:**   (https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython)
  
++LLP- Fun course where you get to make your own games and learn to program at the same time. Quite addictive.

**Euroscipy tutorials
++ARJ - reporsitories forked into STP bioinformatics repo. All good tutorials with ipython notebooks or step by step demos for how to use these useful packages
  
## Django ##
**Django Youtube tutorial series **
(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxA5z-8B2xk4szCgFmgonNcCboyNneMD)
++ARJ  - very clear, easy to follow video series

## Introduction to Computer Science: ##

**Introduction to computer science and programming using python :**
  (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-5)
  
+++LLP- Excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.

**Introduction to computational thinking and data science:** (https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-2x-introduction-computational-2836#.VAhBKsV3Vc0)
  
+++LLP- Excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.
    
**Introduction to computer science CS50 :**    (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
  
+++LLP- Really good, fun, overview of computer science. Excellent explanations of principles. 

##Algorithms:##

**Rosalind:**   (www.rosalind.info)
  
+++LLP- wonderful set of programs to work through slowly. Helpful to do concurrently with any of the learning to program courses as it helps highlight the uses of programming in a biological context.
    
**Bioinformatics Specialisation:**  (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)
  
+++LLP- wonderful course created by the same people as Rosalind. Can be made more or less challenging, online e-book is great. Can't recommend highly enough.  Has been Moved to Edx: (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-genomic-data-science-uc-san-diegox-cse181-1x)

## Introduction to Genomics: ##

**Genomic data science:**    (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomics?utm_medium=courseDescripTop)
  
+LLP- Most courses in the specialisation are very simple, but would give first years a fairly good grounding on the basics
  
## Statistics: ##

**Statistics and R for the life sciences:** (https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-r-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x#!)
  
+LLP- An entire specialisation dealing with data analysis (with R).  First iteration was good, but assignments needed a bit more work (they were too guided), I hear new iterations are better. 

**StatTrek:** (http://stattrek.com/#!)
  
SR- Has been recommended several times. I've not sat down and gone through it, but it looks like a useful reference to dip in and out of. 

**Ben Lambert on YouTube:** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3tFZR3eL1bDY8CqZDOQh-w/#!)
  
+SR- I found his lectures on statistical tests to be clear providing the forumlae as well as an intuitive explanation in plain language. 

## Databases: ##

**Introduction to Databases:**  (https://class.coursera.org/db)
  
+LLP- Good explanation of different kinds of databases. A little dry as a course, for my liking, but gets the basic job done.

## Physics rotation: ##

**Circuits and Electronics:**   (https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.002_4x/3T2014/info)
  
LLP- I found this course post-Liverpool. But I went through it for completness sake. It's pretty good and could be of use if you are keen, but not required.
 
## Introduction to other programming languages ##

** Programming MotherF\*\*\#\#r ** (http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html)

++MW- A series of short courses covering a whole range of niches... web development, scripting, OOP, database work, programming frameworks. I've used these resources to pick up Perl, Java, Python, SQL, Django and a couple of others I've dropped since. Entertaining reads and the pacing of the courses is about right. Also... How many software course have their own merchandise?
