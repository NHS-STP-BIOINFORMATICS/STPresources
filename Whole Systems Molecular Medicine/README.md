[Mathematical Modelling in Systems Biology - Brian Ingalls](Mathematical_Modelling_in_Systems_Biology_Brian_Ingalls.pdf)

Excerpt:

>Mathematical modelling is becoming an increasingly valuable tool for molecular cell biology. Consequently, **it is important for life scientists to have a background in the relevant mathematical techniques, so that they can participate in the construction, analysis, and critique of published models**. On the other hand, those with mathematical training—mathematicians, engineers and physicists—now have increased opportunity to participate in molecular cell biology research. 

>This book aims to provide both of these groups—readers with backgrounds in cell biology or mathematics—with an introduction to the key concepts that are needed for the construction and investigation of mathematical models in molecular systems biology

Excerpt:

>This text starts with an introduction to dynamical systems. It then describes buildingblocks used when modeling molecular interactions, and introduces how these ’bricks’ are combined into models of large biochemical networks. Then different parameter estimation and analysis methods are discussed.

>In the end there is a discussion on diffusion and the combination of reactions and diffusion into one model. The text is very sparse and **it is meant to be used as lecture notes for both teacher(!) and students.**
