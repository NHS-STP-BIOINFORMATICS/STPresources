Introduction to Bioinformatics (for the first rotation particularly non biologists):
  Life sciences in your computer:    https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinform
    +LLP- Ideal for those from a non-biology background to get to grips with the first rotation in genetics. 
  Bioinformatic methods I&II:   https://class.coursera.org/bioinfomethods1-001
    +LLP- Same as above and covers similar topics. Good for general background.

Introductory level Python courses:
  codecademy python :    https://www.codecademy.com/learn
    +LLP- Good intro to the syntax of python. You  get through the course fairly quickly. Composed of small, guided, exercises
  Python for everybody:    https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python
    ++LLP- Very clearly explained programming principles. Useful to get to grips with python quickly.
  Interactive programming through python:   https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython
    ++LLP- Fun course where you get to make your own games and learn to program at the same time. Quite addictive.
  
Introduction to Computer Science:
  Introduction to computer science and programming using python :    https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-5
    +++LLP- Excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.
  Introduction to computational thinking and data science:  https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-2x-introduction-computational-2836#.VAhBKsV3Vc0
    +++LLP- Excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.
  Introduction to computer science CS50 :    https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x
    +++LLP- Really good, fun, overview of computer science. Excellent explanations of principles. 

Algorithms:
  Rosalind:   www.rosalind.info
    +++LLP- wonderful set of programs to work through slowly. Helpful to do concurrently with any of the learning to program courses as it helps highlight the uses of programming in a biological context.
  Bioinformatics Specialisation:  https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics
    +++LLP- wonderful course created by the same people as Rosalind. Can be made more or less challenging, online e-book is great. Can't recommend highly enough. 
Introduction to Genomics:
  Genomic data science:    https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomics?utm_medium=courseDescripTop
    +LLP- Most courses in the specialisation are very simple, but would give first years a fairly good grounding on the basics
  
Statistics:
  Statistics and R for the life sciences: https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-r-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x#!
    +LLP- An entire specialisation dealing with data analysis (with R).  First iteration was good, but assignments needed a bit more work (they were too guided), I hear new iterations are better. 

Databases:
  Introduction to Databases:  https://class.coursera.org/db
    +LLP- Good explanation of different kinds of databases. A little dry as a course, for my liking, but gets the basic job done.
Physics roation: 
  Circuits and Electronics:   https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/6.002_4x/3T2014/info
    LLP- I found this course post-Liverpool. But I went through it for completness sake. It's pretty good and could be of use if you are keen, but not required.
